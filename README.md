Bil-Kay" is a friend-matcher software developed for Bilkent students. Our aim with this software is to allow Bilkent students to socialize with each other practically by finding new friends who share common areas of interest to meet. This software is based on an algorithm that matches one user to another and chooses similar categories of various interests like sports, technology, art, movies etc.

Let's have a gym program with Bil-Kay gym program generator and compare your program with your friends' programs. 

Because of our campus' location and size, we are aware of how transportation is difficult for Bilkenteners, so that Bil-Kay serves you "Bil-Uber" to overcome with this difficulty. You can use Bil-Uber in two roles which are "Driver" and "Passenger". If you want to be a driver, then you need to create a lift which includes the following information: Date, Time, Route (From where To where), Fee (optional), and Available seats. After you created a lift, it becomes visible in "Available Lifts" list by every user and in "My Offered Lift" list by only you. If you wish to be a passenger, then the process because easier as you all need to do is selecting lifts that you want from "Available Lifts" and then those selected lifts will become visible in "Booked Lifts" list only by you.
