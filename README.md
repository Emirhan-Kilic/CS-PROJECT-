Bil-Kay" is a friend-matcher software developed for Bilkent students. Our aim with this software is to allow Bilkent students to socialize with each other practically by finding new friends who share common areas of interest to meet. This software is based on an algorithm that matches one user to another and chooses similar categories of various interests like sports, technology, art, movies, songs, and the same clubs/communities of the university.![image](https://github.com/tavus-umit/CS-PROJECT-/assets/113942955/2dc3806c-ee90-439c-b2c4-02ec300286dc)
